    "review": "Great place in a good location with really friendly and helpful staff. They helped me organise stuff to do in Istanbul and can organise trips around Turkey to Cappadocia or boat trips around the coast. I had a fantastic time in Istanbul and staying here made the end of my travels amazing. They also had good advice for how to get to Ataturk airport avoiding the traffic by taking the tram and metro which meant a far less stressful and easier journey when I had to leave.",

    "review": "Really cool place to stay if you only have around 2-5 days and you focus on the sightseeing stuff. Only 4minutes away from THE main attractions, so you don't even have to get up so early and you will still be the first in line. Excellent staff. They take good care of you and give good recommendations to anything. It's not to easy to get through the city with the luggage. Next time I'd take a taxi from AtatÃ¼rk Airport or a taxi from Taksim Square (after a bus ride from Sabiha GÃ¶kcen Airport).",

They treated me like family, invited me along to a football match, and were always fun to be around. If visiting Istanbul, you can't go wrong at Cheeers Lighthouse.",

It was a lovely surprise to come down to breakfast -staff really attentive -with an open fronted restaurantwith a view out across the Bhosphorus.Chilled atmosphere really contemporary and just a short walk up the road to 'all the old stuff'. Did I mention its the right side of the water for Ataturk airport and prices not bad either. Dont rely on me you want to try it out for yourselves",

The location was perfect - I was walking distance to everything and I felt safe walking around on my own. Everyone at the hostel was so welcoming and friendly. They were available whenever I needed anything or had any questions. My room was way better than what I expected - good size, clean, comfortable and really nice bathrooms.",

Emre and his team never stop working, and even though I got there well after midnight following a crazy travel day of missed connections, they were there to greet me and upgraded me to a private rooftop room with a great view. Look forward to staying with them again soon!",

We actually stayed at Cheers Mansion which is sort of a boutique Hs, just 5 minute walk from Lighthouse. Mansion is really neat with great facilities, for those who search a quiet atmosphere. And if you are in the mood of getting some fun, the owners will walk you & join you at Cheers Bar just 10 min away for some drinks, great Atmosphere at Cheers!...",

The location is perfect-a view of the Bosphorous from our room and within walking distance of major sites. Rooms were of hotel quality and kept very clean. Very complete breakfast withTurkish tea available at any time. The staff was personable, kind, and informative giving us recommendations of local places to visit each day. We felt they genuinely cared about making our experience safe and unique.",
